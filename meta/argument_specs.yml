                  otherwise, it will be less aggressive and therefore block and
                  scan with less frequency.

                  There are five values for setting cloud block level:

                  * Normal (C(normal)): The default blocking level.
                  * Moderate (C(moderate)): Delivers verdict only for high

                  * High (C(high)): Aggressively blocks unknown files while
                    optimizing for performance (greater chance of blocking
                    non-harmful files).
                  * High Plus (C(high_plus)): Aggressively blocks unknown files
                    and applies additional protection measures (might impact
                    client device performance).
                  * Zero Tolerance (C(zero_tolerance)): Blocks all unknown
                    programs.
